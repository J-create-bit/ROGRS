            <p>OGRS was designed as a replacement of TIGRS, which was taken down for unknown reasons. OGRS is a free self-rating system, aimed primarily at indie game developers.</p>
            <p>If you are a parent/consumer, please know that games are not rated by a board, but are rated by the developer. We claim no responsibility for the mis-rating of games.</p>
            <p>If you're a game developer and want to rate your game, head over to the <a href="generator">generator</a> page to generate a rating.</p>
