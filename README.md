ROGRS
====

**ROGRS** (Rogers), is a fork from the Open-source Game Rating System wich was first designed as a replacement for TIGRS, The Independent Game Rating System. TIGRS became very popular, but the website was eventually taken down for unknown reasons. [k80w](https://github.com/k80w) decided to rewrite her own version, using an [archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20110728111855/http://www.tigrs.org/?page=generate) of the page as a reference. k80w (Katie Wolfe) had hosted OGRS at the following site: http://dnaf.github.io/OGRS/, but now this link is broken, giving a 404 error.

The OGRS project was archived by the owner on Oct 22, 2019. It is now read-only. I found it while browsing the Internet looking for an open source game rating system, and decided to give it a try. I was dissapointed when I realised that the project was archived, but I tought that it was a good idea to fork the project, rename it as ROGRS (Renewed Open-Source Game Rating System [OGRS]) and maintain it as long as I can.

ROGRS is based on OGRS and TIGRS, combining both visual systems but maintaining some rules from each system. ROGRS consists of four categories: ALL, PRETEENS, TEENS, and ADULTS. They are differentiated by image, color, number, and text. Above, you can see the four categories and their labels. Below is a small table.

|  | E (Everyone)  | P (Preteens) | T (Teens) | A (Adults) |
